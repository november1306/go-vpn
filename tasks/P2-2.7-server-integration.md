# P2-2.7 Server Integration & Registration Flow

## Summary
Integrate all server components into a working registration and peer management system.

## Deliverables
- Complete server implementation in `cmd/server/main.go`:
  - WireGuard interface management
  - HTTP API with registration endpoint
  - File-based user storage integration
  - API key authentication
  - IP allocation for new users
- Full registration flow: client sends email + public key â†’ server returns API key + config

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Server starts with WireGuard interface active
- [ ] Registration endpoint creates new users and assigns IPs
- [ ] User data persists across server restarts
- [ ] Multiple concurrent registrations work correctly

## Dependencies
P1-1.4, P2-2.2, P2-2.5, P2-IP-allocator, P2-HTTP-server-and-middleware

## Estimate
4 days

## Notes
- Focus on making the complete server-side flow work end-to-end
