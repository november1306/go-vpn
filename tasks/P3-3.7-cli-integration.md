# P3-3.7 CLI Integration & Full Client Flow

## Summary  
Complete CLI implementation with all commands working against the server and local WireGuard.

## Deliverables
- Full `vpn-cli` implementation with:
  - `register <email>` - generates keys, calls server API, stores config
  - `connect` - reads config, starts local WireGuard interface, routes traffic
  - `disconnect` - stops WireGuard, restores routing  
  - `status` - shows connection state and assigned IP
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux)
- Error handling and user-friendly messages

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete registration → connect → disconnect → status flow works
- [ ] Client config stored securely with proper file permissions
- [ ] Network routing configured correctly for full tunnel
- [ ] Graceful error handling for common failure cases

## Dependencies
P3-3.1 through P3-3.6, P2-2.7

## Estimate
5 days

## Notes
- Requires administrator privileges for network configuration
- Test end-to-end with real server instance
