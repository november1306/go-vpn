# P1-1.2 Integrate wireguard-go Library

## Summary
Add `golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go` and validate minimal device creation in a spike.

## Deliverables
- Dependency added to `go.mod`
- Spike code in `internal/wireguard/spike/` that creates a TUN and a `device.Device` (guarded by build tag `spike`)
- Doc `internal/wireguard/README.md` with notes on API usage and pitfalls

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `go list -m all` shows wireguard-go
- [ ] Spike runs on Linux in a sandbox VM and prints device up/down without panic

## Dependencies
P1-1.1

## Estimate
2 days

## Notes
- Avoid committing privileged scripts beyond docs at this stage
